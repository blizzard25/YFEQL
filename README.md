# https---github.com-blizzard25-YahooFinanceExchangeQueryLibrary

Simple C# class library for working with the Yahoo Finance Exchange database. Library
auto-generates a YQL query, which will return an XML page containing currency exchange
rate data for a given input list of currency codes from a base currency of an input target currency. The library
then parses this XML to return the desired currency exchange rate from that target currency.

NOTES: Library is under construction still, there are existing errors.
